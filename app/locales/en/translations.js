The measures you just completed provide scores on each of these traits and your results are described below.",

        "hiAgree": "High scorers tend to be considerate and polite in social interactions, and enjoy cooperating with others. They find it easy to trust people, and feel compassion for those in need. High scorers tend to be well liked by their peers, and they establish satisfying and stable close relationships. They are more likely to be religious, to serve in community leadership roles, and to do volunteer work. Older adults tend to score higher than younger adults.",
        "hiConsc": "High scorers tend to be organized and responsible. They work hard to achieve their goals, and complete tasks they have begun. High scorers tend to earn higher grades in school, and perform better in many occupations. They are more likely to be religious and hold conservative political attitudes. They tend to exercise more, have better physical health, and live longer. Older adults tend to score higher than younger adults.",
        "hiExtra": "High scorers tend to be talkative and energetic. They like being around people, and are comfortable asserting themselves in a group. High scorers tend to have more friends and dating partners, and are seen as more popular. They are more likely to serve in community leadership roles, and to do volunteer work. They tend to prefer energetic music, exercise more frequently, and are more likely to play a sport. They experience more frequent positive emotions, and react more strongly to positive events.",
        "hiNeurot": "High scorers tend to be emotionally stable and resilient. They usually stay calm, even in stressful situations, and can quickly bounce back from negative events. People who score high on emotional stability tend to feel a greater sense of well-being.",
        "hiOpen": "High scorers are generally open to new activities and new ideas. They tend to be creative, intellectually curious, and sensitive to art and beauty. High scorers tend to prefer, and do better in, scientific and artistic occupations. They prefer classical, jazz, blues, and rock music.",
        "loAgree": "Low scorers express themselves directly and bluntly, even at the risk of starting an argument. They enjoy competition, and tend to be skeptical of other people's intentions. Low scorers tend to earn higher salaries, and are more likely to engage in some risky behaviors, such as smoking and aggressive driving.",
        "loConsc": "Low scorers tend to act spontaneously rather than making plans, and find it easier to look at the big picture than pay attention to details. They prefer to jump between tasks, instead of finishing one at a time. They tend to engage in more risky behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use.",
        "loExtra": "Low scorers tend to be socially and emotionally reserved. They generally prefer to be alone or with a few close friends, and keep their opinions and feelings to themselves. They are less likely to engage in thrill-seeking activities or risky behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.",
        "loNeurot": "Low scorers tend to be emotionally sensitive, and have up-and-down mood swings. They experience more frequent negative emotions, and react more strongly to negative events. Younger adults tend to score lower than older adults.",
        "loOpen": "Low scorers tend to be traditional, practical, and like to stick with traditional ways of doing things. They prefer the familiar over the new, and the concrete over the abstract. Low scorers tend to prefer, and do better in, conventional and practical occupations such as crafts and trades.",
